# bulleted-list

Bulleted List is a custom Salesforce Marketing Cloud Content Builder block using the [blocksdk](https://github.com/salesforce-marketingcloud/blocksdk).

Bulleted List creates an email-ready bulleted list.  Unlike the bulleted list that can be created via the WYSIWYG Freeform Editor, the list generated by this content block is an HTML table and will render precisely with nearly all email clients.
